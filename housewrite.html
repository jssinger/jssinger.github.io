      <p>We are very excited to announce that the TAG quizbowl team has created a middle school level set to be played in the 2020-2021 quizbowl season. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we do not yet know how the set will be played, be it online or in person. This set contains 20 tossups and 20 bonuses for 15 rounds, supporting lengthy prelims and playoffs. This set is being written by the TAG Quizbowl Team, and edited by Alistair Gray, Ketan Pamurthy, and Jisoo Yoo.</p>

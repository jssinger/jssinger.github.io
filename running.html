        <header class="header">Getting Started</header>
        <p>To get started in running, you must slowly build up endurance by attempting to run, at any pace for as long as possible</p>
        The key to starting running is not to focus on pace early on.
        <p>Make sure to get proper rest, especially early on, to prevent shin splits and other injuries common to new runners</p>

        <header class="header">Preparing for Runs</header>
        <p>There are several ways you can prepare for a run to maximize the running experience.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Prepare your route</li>
                <p>Use route planning software like <a href="https://onthegomap.com/#/create">On The Go Maps</a> to plan out routes with ideal length and elevation.</p>
            <li>Prepare your legs</li>
                <p>Streching before a run is generally inadvised. Instead, warm up by walking around and starting the run off at a slow, easy to maintian pace.</p>
            <li>Prepare your stomach</li>
                <p>There are few better ways to ruin a run than by screwing up your food. While exact times may vary, avoiding foods high in dairy, sugar, or fat as much as two hours before a run will help you prevent painful cramps. Eating the right kinds of foods before a run is helpful to provide your body with fuel. Fruits, vegetables, and whole grains serve as clean fuel before a run. </p>
            <li>Prepare your mind</li>
                <p>Put on some music, podcasts, or books shortly before your run to entertain yourself while running. If you prefer to keep things quiet to allow you to think, do so. Running is a highly meditative activity; don't be afrait to allow yourself to get lost in thought! </p>
            <li>Prepare your recovery</li>
                <p>After finishing your run, allow your legs to cool down by walking around for a couple of minutes. Afterwards, take a shower and stretch your legs to prevent injury. <br>
                    Make sure to sleep at around 8 hours to allow your muscles to rest and grow.</p>
        </ul>

        <p>Runners keen on preventing injury must be sure to maintain key practices to stay heal
        Rest is one of the biggest factor in preventing wear-and-team injuries.
        In addition, wearing appropriate shoes is a worthwhile investment, within reason.
